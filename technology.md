# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. As a query techonoly we will use some SQL in Postgres to merge and analyze the complete data prior to start our analysis.

## Database Storage
Postgres will be the tool we will use to store our data in SQL, we will use pandas to read the information out from a CSV source and will move those dataframes into a SQL databases.

We will use 13 F1 related data.

## Machine Learning
For Correlation analysis we will use R geom_point() plotting function combined with the cor() function to quantify the correlation between variables. Also we will use the lm() function in R or the sklearn for linear regression module in python to calculate the multiple linear regression model. The idea is to apply linear regression to define the level of relationship between variables 

For Machine Learning we are planning to use sklearn (LogisticRegression, SVC and RandomForestClassifier) module and hvplot for ploting mainly. Also if it is necessary we will use tensorflow to run a neural network model

Other statistical techniques as PCA will help us to create clusters and with that define if either the constructor or the pilot has more leverage on winning a race.

## Dashboard
In order to create visual graphs and the story telling about our analysis, we will use Tableau and python as the vizualization tool amoung others. With this we will be able to share our findings in a more graphical manner for our collaborators.
