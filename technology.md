# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. As a query techonoly we will use some SQL in Postgres to merge and analyze the complete data prior to start our analysis.

## Database Storage
Postgres will be the tool we will use to store our data in SQL, we will use pandas to read the information out from a CSV source and will move those dataframes into a SQL databases.

We will use 13 F1 related data.

## Machine Learning
For Machine Learning we are planning use sklearn for linear regression analysis and hvplot for ploting mainly. The idea is to apply linear regression to define the level of relationship between variables and then use PCA to create clusters and with that define if either the constructor or the pilot has more leverage on winning a race.

## Dashboard
In order to create visual graphs and the story telling about our analysis, we will use Tableau and python as the vizualization tool amoung others. With this we will be able to share our findings in a more graphical manner for our collaborators.
