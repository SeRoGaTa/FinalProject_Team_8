# Formula 1 Analysis

## Overview 
In this project, we are interested in identifying and determining the main factors that intervene in a race and what of those have an impact on the final result.

Formula 1 races have two fundamental elements that constantly interact, the drivers and the cars, which of these two factors is more relevant in the final result?

Factors like time in the pits, type of tracks, crucial faults, qualifying times affect the final result?

## Research question

Determining the factors that are most relevant to determining the winner of some race.
Some of the factor to considerer are:

-Pit times
-Earn rating
-Number of constructor championships
-Number of construction failures
-Years of pilot experience
-Best times / lap times
-Tracks
-Previous results of constructors and pilots

## Database Source
Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2021)

The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2021 season.

## Communication protocols 

We decide to use direct messages for only team members in Slack and establish a daily meetup time for everyone on saturdays.

We use GitHub as a communication protocol by creating a personal branch for each member. Git allow us to save the progress of the proyect and keep the tracks of our work.

**Create a branch** 

Using branches let us work on our local repository to then update to the main branch and have the chance to review the branch or offer suggestions. In this space we can test modifications in the code without the problem of affecting the global code or the advances made

```ruby
git Branch -d nomeofbranch
```

**Open a pull request** 

After having tested our code locally, we proceed to perform a pull request to merge the code

```ruby
git status
git add .
git commmit -m "Commit message"
git push --set upstream origin <Branch-Name>
```

**Discuss and review**

At least one teammate has to review the pull request, if it is necesarry suggest changes and approve the changes to be merged

**Merge and deploy**

After approval, the member who pull the request can merge the changes into the main branch

## Week logs 

### Week 1

During the first week, all the members of the team investigated topics of interest that would help us to decide on a topic to work on. By vote the team decided on the topic, later we agreed on the research question.

The team decided that each member of the team review the databases to become familiar with the data and meet over the weekend to determine which databases to use, if any transformations or joins are needed, and define the model to use.
